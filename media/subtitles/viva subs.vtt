00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.200
I used to rule the world

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.000
Seas would rise when I gave the word

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.000
Now in the morning I sleep alone

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:32.200
Sweep the streets I used to own

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.900
I used to roll the dice

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.100
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.100
Listen as the crowd would sing

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.400
"Now the old king is dead!
Long live the king!"

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.900
One minute I held the key

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.900
Next the walls were closed on me

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.800
And I discovered that my castles stand

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.200
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.800
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.100
Be my mirror, my sword and shield

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.600
My missionaries in a foreign field

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.100
For some reason I can't explain

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.200
Once you're gone there was never

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.000
Never an honest word

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:42.200
But that was when I ruled the world

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.300
It was the wicked and wild wind

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.400
Blew down the doors to let me in

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.400
Shattered windows and the sound of drums

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.800
People couldn't believe what I'd become

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.500
Revolutionaries wait

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.400
For my head on a silver plate

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.800
Just a puppet on a lonely string

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.100
Oh who would ever want to be king?

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.800
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.200
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.600
Be my mirror, my sword and shield

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.100
My missionaries in a foreign field

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.600
For some reason I can't explain

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.900
I know Saint Peter won't call my name

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.300
Never an honest word

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:51.500
But that was when I ruled the world

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.500
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.800
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.300
Be my mirror, my sword and shield

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.700
My missionaries in a foreign field

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.200
For some reason I can't explain

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.500
I know Saint Peter won't call my name

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.800
Never an honest word

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000
But that was when I ruled the world

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:54.000
